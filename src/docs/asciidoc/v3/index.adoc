[[create-item]]
=== Create Item

A `POST` request to create a new content item. Note that content items are created using a multipart
form request so that multiple different parts can be provided. These include the metadata for
the item in JSON format and the file itself.

The metadata is the multipart item "document" and the file is the multipart item "attachment".

Different content profiles require different metadata to be provided, and it can be tricky to identify
the correct combination of metadata by trial-and-error, so you may want to contact the EDM team
to get a sample JSON for the metadata you will be submitting before proceeding.

[[Update-item]]
=== Update Item

A `POST` or `PUT` request to update an existing document
If you don't send an `attachment`, only the metadata will be updated.
Note that content items are updated using a multipart form request just like the create item
payload above.

The metadata is the multipart item "document" and the file is the multipart item "attachment".
